      <description>Hi, My name is Spiegel ish.
 Life is stranger than fiction because fiction has to make sense.
I&amp;rsquo;m weak with words and sentences. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to talk to other people. But I&amp;rsquo;m doing my best to get over this situation.
The purpose of this blog is this, and if you know me or want to know me, please bear with me.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to tell you my day x day life stories with my own very words.</description>
